### Hey, I'm Jeffrey Wong! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a dedicated and ambitious computing science student currently in my 3rd year at Simon Fraser University. With a strong passion for technology and a drive to learn and grow, I'm always looking for new opportunities to expand their knowledge and skills in the field of computing science.
